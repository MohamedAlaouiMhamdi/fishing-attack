# fishing-attack
A fishing attack, also known as a phishing attack, is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker attempts to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information by posing as a trustworthy entity.

This is typically done through email, instant messaging, or social media messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank, an online retailer, or a social media platform. The message may include a link to a fake website that looks like the real one, but is designed to steal the victim's login credentials or other sensitive information.

Fishing attacks can also involve phone calls or text messages that ask the victim to provide personal information or to click on a link that will install malware on their device.

To avoid falling victim to a fishing attack, it's important to be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or phone calls asking for personal information. Always verify the legitimacy of the source before providing any sensitive information or clicking on any links, and use two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.
